Kornbrew
=========

Run & play missing package manager for POSIX compatible systems

In which use cases I could use Kornbrew?
----------------------------------------

I did Kornbrew to suply my needs about installing 3r party software as simple user at:
- Cluster environment
- Remote shell accounts
- When I need some specific version or the latest version of some software.
- College's students lab. They could install whatever wants, and the machine keeps always as brand new instalation.
- Don't need to use root in a desktop or workstation(With or without X).


ToDo
----

I'm rewritting the code to Perl. Thus, Kornbrew can be used, not only in OpenBSD, but in Linux distros, etc.
